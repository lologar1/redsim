=== Block texture mapping documentation ===
Each line in blockmap.txt maps a unique block ID (starting from 0) to its block handles.
Variants live on the same line and are separated by a single space character, without a terminating space.

If a handle starts with *, then a corresponding item sprite is assumed to exist. The sprites must be packed in their own GUI texture bundles from right to left, up to down, according to the order their handles appear in blockmap.

If a handle contains $, then the decimal number following it is taken as the number of textures that block uses. The default is 1.

If a handle contains :, then the decimal number following it is taken as the metadata for that handle. The default is 0.

Note that the texture tile specification ($) must come before the metadata specification (:), otherwise it will get ignored.

Inside blocks/ lives two or three files per texture, named [handle].png, [handle].mesh and [handle].boundingbox.

The first is a RSM_BLOCK_TEXTURE_SIZE_PIXELS by (number of textures) sized .png file containing the image data for the texture.

The second is actually a text file containing the mesh data and how it associates with the texture data
in the following format:
	Each line must start with either 'o' (opaque vertex data), 't' (transparent vertex data),
	'i' (opaque index data) or 'e' (transparent index data)

	Following a 'v' or 't', eight space-separated float values are required, not terminating with a space :
	3 describing the XYZ position of the vertex in space, relative to a 1x1x1 box whose corner sits at
	0.0, 0.0, 0.0. **By convention, West-Up-North is +X, +Y, +Z**.
	3 describing the normal vector of this vertex
	2 describing the relative texture coordinates of the vertex

	Following an 'i', any number of space-separated indices to a vertices are required to describe
	the block mesh.

	Note that index triplets (triangles) must be stated in clockwise order if an observer were to be
	looking at them in the inverse direction of their normal. This is needed for face culling.

The third is optional and only required of blocks which have collision with the player.
	It consists of three float values representing the corner of the bounding box facing North,
	at relative 0.0 0.0 0.0 and three float values representing its width, depth and height (x, y, z).
	As always, they extend in the plus directions (West, Up, North).

GUI texture mapping documentation
Each line in guimap.txt maps to a unique GUI element. No variants are possible ; one element per line.
Inside gui/ lives one .png file (sized RSM_GUI_TEXTURE_SIZE_PIXELS squared) representing the element texture.
For icons, a .layout file also exists specifying an item name (same name as in blockmap) per line, in order, which will be displayed in that inventory submenu
