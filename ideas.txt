Blocks are either support or component. Support blocks may be placed anywhere while components may only be
placed on top of support blocks.

Support blocks may be either solid (conductor) or transparent (insulator).
Non-insulators hold a "power status" which is equal to the highest signal strength (ss) feeding into it.

There are a few primitive components:
	Wire
		Can be placed only on top of blocks but may "climb" 1-high steps between blocks.
	Diode
		Actually a support block, but doesn't transmit current from under to over itself.
	Constant source
		Actually a support block, but has a constant power status
	Inverter
		Can be placed either on top or on the sides of support blocks.
		If the block is not an insulator, the state of the inverter is the inverse of its power status.
	Buffer
		Delays an input by 2^n ticks where n is its manually-set delay state (max 16 ticks), 1t throughput
	Analog transistor
		Outputs its principal input ss - max of its side input ss, clamped at 0
	Digital transistor
		Outputs its principal input if its side input ss is equal or lower than it
	Amplifying diode
		Outputs max ss if its input is at least 1
