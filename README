# >>> Welcome to Redsim ! <<<

Redsim (RSM) is a 3D circuit simulator written in C and OpenGL.

DOCUMENTATION
	Documentation for most of RSM can be found in the documentation/ folder (.docs text files).

	Most of the documentation is qualitative (no in-depth input-output specifications for functions...) as
	functionality can be derived by looking at the source code in conjunction with the documentation.

	Keep in mind this documentation mostly refers to RSM's implementation and not its usage. For help, see
	below or refer to the in-game help command for more details.

BUILDING RSM
	Currently, RSM uses the following libraries, some of which must be installed your system:
		GLFW (dependency)
		GLAD (included)
		stb_image (included)
		cglm (dependency)
		usflib2 (dependency; can be found in my github)
	usflib2 must be compiled then symlinked in the redsim/ directory (same level as the Makefile).

	Then, simply run `make` to produce the executable.

INFORMATION
	For more details, refer to the in-game help command.

	RSM allows you to build complex circuits in 3D space, which can then be simulated on-the-fly (interactive
	mode) or compiled and optimized for fast evaluation (compiled mode).

	Every RSM configuration option, such as movement keys, hotbar and slot counts, etc. can be modified in
	the src/rsmlayout.c (these options are subject to change at runtime) or src/rsmlayout.h.
