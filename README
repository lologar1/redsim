>>> Welcome to Redsim ! <<<

Redsim (RSM) is a 3D circuit simulator written in C and OpenGL.

BUILDING RSM
	Currently, RSM uses the following libraries, some of which must be installed your system:
		GLFW (dependency)
		GLAD (included)
		stb_image (included)
		cglm (dependency)
		FreeType (dependency)
		usflib2 (dependency; can be found in my github)
	usflib2 must be compiled then symlinked in the redsim/ directory (same level as the Makefile).

	Then, simply run `make` to produce the executable.

INFORMATION
	RSM allows you to build complex circuits in 3D space, which can then be evaluated in-game at high speeds.

	RSM configuration options, such as keybinds or flyspeed, can be adjusted either through the in-game
	config command, the src/rsmlayout.c file (default states), or the include/rsmlayout.c file.

	For more details, refer to the in-game help command.

DEFAULT LAYOUT
	ESC to toggle mouse capture, or switch back to NORMAL mode
	CTRL+Q to save and exit

	WASD to move

	Left click to destroy
	Right click to place or interact
	Middle click to pipette
	'f' to force-place (hold)

	't' to open command prompt
	':' as command prefix
	CTRL+R to clear command log, or prompt if open

	Scroll wheel to change hotbar slots
	'0' to '9' to choose hotbar slot ('1' first, '0' last)
	'x' and 'z' to change hotbars (scroll forwards or backwards)

	'e' to open inventory
	Left click to interact with inventory

For a list of configuration options, such as sensitivity, flight speed, or render distance, consult
either src/rsmlayout.c, or src/command.c for their aliases.
